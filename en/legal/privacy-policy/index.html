A cookie will usually contain the name of the website from which the cookie has come from, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e. how long it will remain on your device), and a value, which is usually a randomly generated unique number.</p>
<p>Our website uses cookies. They collect statistical data about your browsing actions and behaviour and do not identify you as an individual. Cookies may for example be used to store your country or language preference. This helps to improve our website and deliver a better service.</p>
