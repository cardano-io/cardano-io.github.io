<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Newletter</b></p>
<p>The provisions of this data privacy statement also apply to the request for and sending of our newsletter.</p>
<p>The newsletter will only be sent after prior request by the user in the so-called &#8220;double opt-in procedure&#8221; (request on our website and confirmation of a corresponding request e-mail).</p>
<p>Users of the newsletter are also assigned a UserID, which allows Cardano Foundation to determine when the relevant newsletter was opened and which links or functions from the relevant newsletter were activated. This tracking is done for internal optimization of the newsletter. This data will not be passed on to third parties. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR, where by Cardano Foundation&#8217;s authorization arises from<br />
the fact that, on the one hand, Cardano Foundation has an interest in evaluating such data for purposes of newsletter optimisation and, on the other hand, a concerned person can reasonably foresee at the time when the personal data is collected and in view of the circumstances under which it is carried out (in particular the above-mentioned measures) that it will possibly be processed for this purpose.</p>
<p>The user has the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. If the user of the newsletter does not wish to receive this tracking, he/she can unsubscribe from the newsletter. To do so, simply unsubscribe via the link in the newsletter or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@cardanofoundation.org">info@cardanofoundation.org</a> or send a message to the following address:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano Stiftung, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gubelstrasse 11, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zug, 6300, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switzerland</span></p>
<p>The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on<br />
consent before its withdrawal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Where we store your personal information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored in, a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us. The laws in some countries may not provide the same legal protection for your information as in the EEA. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will always do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use good procedures and strong security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</span></p>
